== For SNU/2D/Programming Tools/IDE/MediaWiki ==

The project language file for this project is MediaWiki/WikiText, as this project (SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_MediaWiki) focuses directly on MediaWiki.

This is the first time I am using WikiText/MediaWiki as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language. I found this out 2 days ago when snooping around on [https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes Apple/Swift Evolution] and I have now expanded it to 4 languages. if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your <code>.gitattributes</code> file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but <code>.gitattributes</code>)

<code>*.wiki linguist-detectable=true</code>

<code>*.wiki linguist-documentation=false</code>
